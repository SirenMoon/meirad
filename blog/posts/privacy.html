# Privacy

Unlike a lot of people these days, I'm for privacy. Everyday I try to learn something on how use privacy and ensure security. Why? Because a lot of people don't and it's something we have taken for granted.

Think about it? Do you feel safe enough to walk around in your birthday suit leaving all your doors and windows unlocked and telling random strangers your credit card numbers and home address? I don't think so. Do you know why? Because some part of you no matter how small values privacy and security. 

I hate to break it to you but privacy and security are important in the digital world too. Let's take email for an example. An unencrypted email might as well be a flyer on your local electric pole but instead of saying 'yard sale', it gives our location, name, email address, and whatever else you decide to include whether it's a picture of you in your birthday suit, credit card information, or your plans to go on vacation for a week and that you're house is now the perfect target for robbers. 

That my friend is a major issue. 

Now add in the fact that you are not only sending this 'metadata' in your email. But you are sending it to perfect strangers on fakebook, twixxter, all your'e other social media sites and more. You're giving it away with apps, text messages, phone calls, you name it. 

What do you get in return? A cheap axx app. 

What do they get? You're voice, photo's, location, phone numbers, health information, coordinates of everywhere you go and shop, your credit information, account numbers, address, where you work and so on. Isn't this the stuff you normally protect in the real world? Hmm...

What else? They get your personality profile, your relationship status, your financial status, if you are planning a trip, your idea's, opinions, and values. Your search results.

And you know what they do with it? They sell it. They catalog it. They keep tabs on it. They watch it. And that's just the beginning. Would you want a criminal to have that kind of power over your life. Copies of your keys? Hell, rights on your kids? I don't think so. So, get you're shit together.  It's time to wake up, because that's just the type of life you're livin. ...
