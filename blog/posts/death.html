# Death

Yesterday evening I went to the mall. Normally that would a happy occasion, but yesterday it was for a funeral. My cousin of just thirteen years old died in a motorbike accident. There wasn't any preventing it. ...

Four people racing in two pairs met in the middle of the track going opposite directions. My cousin, instead of taking out a stranger, veered and crashed into his dad head on. He died on impact from a broken neck, while his father is in the I.C.U. on life support. He has numerous broken bones and had to have heart surgery to reconstruct part of his heart that was damaged from the crash. A lot of us don't think he will make it either. 

What's really sad is the news didn't even report that he was his father. They said he was a stranger. That takes away a lot of the truth. The truth that father and son collided to keep from killing two other people. 

Our family is torn to pieces. They won't even go home because they can't without my cousin. Some don't want to go on anymore at all.

 I logged back into Facebook after years of being away and saw his wall. I broke into tears several times, reading over the messages posted by friends and family. I couldn't bring myself to post anything, it felt too final. Instead I reposted some photo's I took of him two years ago with a broken arm hugging my dog. We're all sharing photo's and video's now. None of truely able to cope with what happened. I think a lot of us are still in a state of disillusionment. 

I'll always remember they way he'd annoy me anyway he could. When he'd borrow my computer and we'd watch dirtbike video's on youtube. When he tried to learn chess at the coffee shop and failed horribly. Then he decided to try my chai tea and spit it back cringing and screaming. Or when he'd grab a sword and pretend he was awsome swinging it back and forth.

In truth, I miss him. We always gave each other shit but we'd forgive each other. My mom said the first day that she was worried about three people the most from this happening. Me, my uncle, and my cousin's sister. She's a pretty good judge of character. The tears keep coming at random. 

When she called me on the phone to tell me what had happened it took me hours to process what she said. I was in denial. I kept telling myself I had dreamed it. Like I had dreamed Bear Grylls had died. I told myself the phone call hadn't happened, while I was crying my eyes out in silence in the other room. 

Two days later and shopping for the funeral. I'm still not over it. I bought a book at the mall to read while at the funeral. For the sole purpose of distracting myself from the whole thing. The family hasn't made the funeral arrangements yet, they can't. So we wait in mourning. We make phone calls. We make stupid jokes in a vain attempt to laugh again.

 We pretend as if we live in two worlds. One where it happened and one where it didn't. A state of semi-being.
