# About

I started learning front-end web development with Thinkful.com this year. Before Thinkful I dabbled, learning GIT, VIM, and whatever tech skills I could easily get my hands on. Now, I plan on furthering my programming & design skills and with a little luck start freelancing by late this year.

I love writing about anthropology, history, privacy, and whatever else comes across my radar. ...
