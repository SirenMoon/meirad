# About

I started learning front-end web development with Thinkful.com this year. Before Thinkful I dabbled, learning GIT, VIM, and whatever tech skills I could easily get my hands on. Now, I plan on furthing my programming & design skills and with a little luck start freelancing by late this year.

I'm also a tech enthusiast. I like to experiment with anything that furthers encryption, free speech, or p2p. Because of this I've successfully built a piratebox in June 2014, and I hope to be able to build a mesh net sometime in the future. I'm also an alpha tester on Serval phone meshnet, Bitmessage, and Twister p2p.
