# Breathing Room

I am for breathing room and not just the walk outside because it's crowded inside kind. For breathing room in all aspects of life. Ever since I could remember I've hated enclosed spaces. Not because there small, but because I feel a sense of impending doom when I think I can't escape from something. 

It started when I was a kid. I had asthma, still do. I was constantly getting attacks from city smog, so my parents would drive us out to the middle of nowhere to a small town named after a fruit. It was miles upon miles of just pine tree's, hammocks, and ice cream parlors. It was breathing room and the smells of pine needles. It was amazing.

Now day's I can't stand being trapped or even the thought of being trapped. I need breathing room. On my computer I need whitespace, and a near empty hard drive. In life I need my tree's, my plants, to get away from all of the daily bull we have to deal with. I need breathing room from thoughts, ideas, chatter, people, and noise. Somewhere with the smell of pine needles and the roar of the wind.

We all feel cramped, disjointed, and bent out of shape at times. Feeling an urge to get away from it all. But what we really want is breathing room. ...
